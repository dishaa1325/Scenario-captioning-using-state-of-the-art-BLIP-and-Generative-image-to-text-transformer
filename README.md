# Scenario-captioning-using-state-of-the-art-BLIP-and-Generative-image-to-text-transformer

**NVIDIA Project Intern — Scenario Captioning using AI Models September 2023 – June 2024**
• Created a custom dataset of 30,000+ image-text pairs tailored for autonomous driving scenarios using
the state-of-the-art BLIP model.
• Developed and fine-tuned the Generative-image-to-text transformer model (GIT) for scenario captioning.
• Improved metric scores like BLEU by 6.3%, METEOR by 9.3%, SPICE by 8.8%, ROUGE by 8.3%,
and Cosine Similarity by 5.1%.
• Demonstrated the model’s real-time performance using Gradio.
